	Dissemination Area

	A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks with 
	an average population of 400 to 700 persons based on data from the previous Census of Population Program. It is the smallest standard 
	geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

	Dissemination Block

	A dissemination block (DB) is an area bounded on all sides by roads and/or boundaries of standard geographic areas. The dissemination 
	block is the smallest geographic area for which population and dwelling counts are disseminated. Dissemination blocks cover all the 
	territory of Canada.

There are 3 datasets in the archive:
	DB Ottawa	: All dissemination blocks for Ottawa		+- 8000 records
	DA Ottawa	: All dissemination areas for Ottawa		+- 1400 records
	DA Ontario	: All dissemination areas for Ontario		+- 20000 records

Each dataset has 4 files:
	* Clean.csv 	: Contains the census geography joined with attribute data (pop count, area, number of dwelling and a couple more). Can be downloaded
			  from Statistics Canada GeoSuite 2016 Census data.
	* Adjacency.csv	: Contains the adjacency for the geographies in the Clean file. Each geography is related to each geography it touches 	
			  by its boundary. The result is a 1 to N relationship. Must be generated by script which processes the geographical boundary file
			  (.gpkg/.shp) into region adjacency relationships.
	* .gpkg/.shp	: Contains geographical boundary information of the areas identified in *Clean.csv and *Adjacency.csv. Can be downloaded from Statistics 			   Canada under geographical boundary files. https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm
