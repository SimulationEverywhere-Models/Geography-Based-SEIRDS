the script generateScenario.sh will create a scenario.json for the Geography-Based-Model (SEIRDS)
the inputs to the process are found in the input folder, the outputs from this process will be located in the output folder

Requirements before running:
the makefile must be altered to point to the correct location of cadmium and json libraries
the python environment must have geopandas installed before running generateScenario.sh

Inputs/Outputs:
the default cell state can be set in input/default.json
the infected cell can be set in input/infectedCell.json
input/fields.json inserts information for message log parsing to be used with IS Web viewer v2
generate_cadmium_json.py will create pre_processing.json which is an unproperly formatted scenario file
the c++ convertScenario program will convert pre_processing.json into a format usable with cadmium master branch

Notes:
The generate_cadmium_json.py script found in the cadmium_gis repository was altered to change the format of the json generated for the model
A C++ script was also needed to alter the formatting of the json generated by the python script
generateScenario.sh will run the python script, generating the geographically correlated cell space and writing the result to a json (pre_processing.json)
generateScenario.sh will then run convertScenario to format pre_processing.json to scenario.json, which includes the fields object (used by message log parser), and overwrites the infected cell specified in infectedCell.json
